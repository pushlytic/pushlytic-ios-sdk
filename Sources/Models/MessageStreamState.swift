import Foundation

/// Represents the various states of the message stream connection in the Pushlytic SDK.
///
/// `MessageStreamState` allows SDK consumers to track the current state of the message stream
/// and handle incoming messages, connection errors, and heartbeat checks seamlessly.
///
/// Cases:
/// - `.connected`: The message stream is successfully connected.
/// - `.messageReceived(String)`: A message has been received from the stream, with the message contents provided as an associated value.
/// - `.heartbeatReceived(String)`: A heartbeat signal has been received, containing a status message.
/// - `.connectionError(Error)`: An error occurred with the message stream connection, providing an `Error` associated value.
/// - `.disconnected`: The message stream connection has been disconnected.
/// - `.timeout`: The connection attempt timed out, typically due to network or server conditions.
///
/// The `Equatable` conformance facilitates efficient state comparison.
enum MessageStreamState: Equatable {
