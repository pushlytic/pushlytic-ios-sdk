/// Protocol defining the contract for managing heartbeat monitoring.

/// `HeartbeatManagerProtocol` enables decoupling of the heartbeat monitoring logic
/// from its implementation, facilitating testing and future extensibility. The protocol
/// defines methods for starting and stopping heartbeat monitoring with configurable intervals.
protocol HeartbeatManagerProtocol: AnyObject {
    
    /// Initializes a heartbeat manager with a timeout handler.
    /// - Parameter timeoutHandler: Closure to be called when a heartbeat timeout occurs.
    init(timeoutHandler: @escaping () -> Void)
    
    /// Starts monitoring heartbeats at the specified interval.
    /// - Parameter interval: The time interval (in seconds) between each heartbeat check.
    ///
    /// This method should handle any cleanup of existing monitoring before starting a new one.
    func startMonitoring(interval: TimeInterval)
    
    /// Stops the heartbeat monitoring.
    ///
    /// This method should ensure proper cleanup of any running timers or resources
    /// to prevent memory leaks or continued execution after stopping.
