/// Protocol for server communication in the Pushlytic SDK.
///
/// `APIClientProtocol` defines the behavior for managing server interactions,
/// such as opening a message stream, registering user-specific data, sending events,
/// and handling metadata.
///
/// This protocol is implemented by the `APIClient` class and serves as the foundation
/// for all server communication within the SDK.
///
/// # Thread Safety
/// All methods are expected to be thread-safe and can be called from any thread.
protocol APIClientProtocol: AnyObject {

    ///
    /// - Returns: `true` if the client is connected, `false` otherwise.
    var isConnected: Bool { get }
    
    /// Opens a bi-directional message stream with the server.
    ///
    /// - Parameter onStateChange: A closure invoked whenever the message stream state changes.
    /// - Note: This method establishes a persistent connection to the server and handles
    ///   incoming messages or connection events.
    func openMessageStream(onStateChange: @escaping (MessageStreamState) -> Void)
    
    /// Registers a user identifier with the server.

    /// - Parameter tags: An array of tags (e.g., feature flags, user segments) to register.

    func registerTags(_ tags: [String])
    
    /// Sends a custom event to the server for analytics or tracking purposes.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - name: The name of the event (e.g., "ButtonClicked").
    ///   - metadata: Additional metadata to send with the event, as a key-value dictionary.
    /// - Note: Metadata can include details such as timestamps, user actions, or session data.

    ///   - operation: The type of operation to perform (`update` or `clear`).
    ///   - metadata: The metadata to update, or `nil` if clearing metadata.
    /// - Note: Metadata provides dynamic configuration or contextual data for the session.

    ///   was initiated by the user.
