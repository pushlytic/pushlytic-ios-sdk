/// Represents the possible connection states of the Pushlytic SDK.
///
/// `ConnectionStatus` helps clients of the SDK understand the current state of the connection, enabling
/// them to manage user experience and retry logic effectively.
///
/// Cases:
/// - `.connected`: The SDK has successfully connected to the message stream.
/// - `.disconnected`: The SDK has been disconnected from the message stream, either intentionally or due to network issues.
/// - `.timeout`: The SDK's connection attempt has timed out, typically due to network conditions.
/// - `.error`: An error occurred during connection, providing details with an associated `PushlyticError`.
///
/// The `Equatable` conformance allows developers to easily compare different states for more efficient connection management.
